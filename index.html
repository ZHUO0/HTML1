    <h1>All about Whales</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Whale, also known as whale, is a common name for a part of the Marine
      mammal cetacea
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      Whales, dolphins and finless porpoises, all belonging to the order
      artiodactylus, and their closest relatives of the two-toed ungulates are
      hippos. They diverged about 40 million years ago, and paleontologists
      believe that they first evolved from bucky whales into amphibious
      cetaceans such as walking whales, and then into fully aquatic cetaceans
      such as Basilosaurus
    </p>
    <h2>Classification</h2>

    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
    <p>
      Whales breathe with their lungs and swim to the surface to breathe every
      four hours. They are warm-blooded, with a body temperature of about 37 and
      a heartbeat of only 10 beats per minute. Their young are fed by mammals
      and have little hair. Some species can dive to great depths, often having
      a thick layer of fat, or blubber, that keeps them warm in cold water

      At present, the whaling countries include Norway, Iceland and Japan, as
      well as the Faroe Islands, Siberia, the United States (Alaska) and some
      indigenous tribes in northern Canada. On the issue of whaling, the
      opposition is mainly some environmental organizations such as Greenpeace,
      the World Wildlife Fund, etc. However, in recent years, the governments of
      Australia, Brazil and other countries have also stepped in to oppose
      whaling
